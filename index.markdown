We are a small design studio in Stockholm, Sweden.

Our background is in open source software from which we're taking the core concepts of openness and sharing. We are now applying it to physical products, hence our motto "show your workings".

We want what we make to be beautiful, functional and fun. But also to be comprehensible - the inner workings should be visible and where possible self explanatory. For hidden elements like design and coding we intend to share this over the internet. Too many things are now black boxes which prevents learning through looking. We believe that things are best not only when they work, but also when you understand how they work.

It is almost a given that any successful idea will be copied, and fast! We have no interest in engaging in the cat and mouse game of copyright and IP enforcement. Wherever possible, and practical, we'll be releasing our work under open licenses such as the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA. This will enable those who wish to build on our work to do so in a non-commercial setting.

And you get paid how? By selling physical items, and partnering with others who wish to manufacture our designs.

Much like in cooking having the recipe is not enough, you also need the ingredients and the equipment. Our designs will incorporate custom parts, electronics and code. For a given design we foresee selling finished products, complete DIY build kits and dedicated parts kits (basically what you can't manufacture yourself using 3D printers etc - you can print a gear, but not a stepper motor). We hope to have a global reach and to use partners around the world to manufacture and distribute locally.

Our first designs are under way. Please [give us your email address](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1pQqFR5enFFgWFgAP2s4ox58Ysb_WUmUhvJMFaU-SkbA4Uw/viewform?usp=header) and we'll let you know when they launch.

We also know that the socials are key. We're on it.
